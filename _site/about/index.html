<p>Hi, my name is Toms Veilands and I&#39;m still learning new things every day that&#39;s why this website is still here for everyone to explore and enjoy. All content here is dedicated for my early days teachers and also for my fellow students who are now in the same shoes as I used to be when I studdied at <a href="http://www.lu.lv/eng/">University of Latvia</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a full time software developer anymore, though my studies in <a href="http://www.lu.lv/eng/">LU</a> did require some programming skills to be learned and also demonstrated. We were given quite a limited development environment where to host our work, mostly <code>static HTML</code> pages and I found out that <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is absolutely perfect solution for rendering <code>static HTML</code> pages and additionally to that will perform beautifull software code highlights via help of <a href="http://pygments.org/" title="Python syntax highlights">Pygments</a>, that is all what I ever wanted and needed, though I got much more included once I learned about the neat features what <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> had to offer out of the box.</p>

<p>Additionally to the mentioned above there is one more tiny thing to add that was missing from our education program, this is a minor fact - that today many websites are being accessed from all kind of different devices, such as tablets, mobile smartphones, TV&#39;s, etc. and it requires a lot of work to fine tune <code>CSS</code> to make the content appear equally good on all possible screens. I found out that <a href="http://sass-lang.com/guide/">Sass</a> is an excellent choice for web developers to address this issue. Once I learned on how to use it I&#39;m much more convinced that my website is still in a good standing order and in compliance with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive web design</a> standards and principles.</p>

<p>On a daily basis I&#39;m employed as an IT project manager at <a href="http://lattelecom.lv/">Lattelecom</a> I love software development for my own pleasure and entertainment and I like it this way. I&#39;m not ready to return back to full time software developer position yet though I loved those days a lot and sometimes I feel a bit nostalgic about that time of my life. Today, when I have to discuss with our software developers about how the solution is going to be built, tested and deployed, we can understand each other much better, I feel much more comfortable than those folks in our IT department who have no programming knowledge and skills at all.</p>

<p>I will keep this information short here, in case if you need something, please don&#39;t hesitate to get in touch with me and I will be happy to handle your request =]
